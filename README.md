IMPORTANT:
This fork doesn't have presets for two obs/source record, instead go to [Two Obs/Source Record Presets](https://github.com/ChezBruhger/Wall-OBS-Presets-No-Source-Record) 

Install [Move Transition Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/) or smooth animations WILL NOT WORK.
You can use this without smooth transition plugin if you prefer a default obs transition like slide. 

Steps to install:
1. Download the zip and extract it using whatever software you have
2. Go to OBS and then click Scene Collection --> Import --> 3 dots

3. Find the folder where the preset is and then select the json file called "Smooth_Multi"
4. Now that it's imported you want to select the preset by hitting Scene Collection --> Smooth Multi
